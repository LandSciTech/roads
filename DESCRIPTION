Description: Project road network development based on an existing road 
    network, target locations to be connected by roads and a cost surface. Road 
    projection methods include minimum spanning tree with least cost path 
    (Kruskal's algorithm (1956) <doi:10.2307/2033241>), least cost path 
    (Dijkstra's algorithm (1959) <doi:10.1007/BF01386390>) or snapping. 
    These road network projection methods are ideal for use with land cover
    change projection models.
