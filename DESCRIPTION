Description: Iterative least cost path and minimum spanning tree methods for projecting 
    forest road networks. The methods connect a set of target points to an existing road network using igraph <https://igraph.org> 
    to identify least cost routes. The cost of constructing a road segment between adjacent pixels is determined by a user supplied 
    `weightRaster` and a `weightFunction`; options include the average of adjacent `weightRaster` values, 
    and a function of the elevation differences between adjacent cells that penalizes steep grades. These road network projection 
    methods are intended for integration into R workflows and modelling frameworks used for forecasting forest change, 
    and can be applied over multiple timesteps without rebuilding a graph at each timestep.
