Description: Road network projection methods for use with landcover change projection models. This package is in development, and may or may not function. We are in the process of adapting a BC-specific SpaDES module (https://github.com/bcgov/clus/tree/master/R/SpaDES-modules/roadCLUS) for general use. Here a description of the methods: https://github.com/bcgov/clus/blob/master/reports/roads/draft-CLUS-roads.md .
