Description: Iterative least cost path and minimum spanning tree methods for projecting 
    forest road networks. The methods connect a set of target points to an existing 
    road network using 'igraph' <https://igraph.org> to identify least cost routes.
    The cost of constructing a road segment between adjacent pixels is determined
    by a user supplied weight raster and a weight function; options include the
    average of adjacent weight raster values, and a function of the elevation 
    differences between adjacent cells that penalizes steep grades. These road
    network projection methods are intended for integration into R workflows and 
    modelling frameworks used for forecasting forest change, and can be applied 
    over multiple time-steps without rebuilding a graph at each time-step.
