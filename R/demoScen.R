#' Demonstration set of 10 input scenarios
#'
#' A demonstration set of scenarios that can be used as input to
#' [projectRoads()]. The data contains `SpatRaster` objects that
#' must be wrapped to be stored. To unwrap them use [prepExData()]
#'
#' @docType data
#'
#' @usage data(demoScen)
#'
#' @format A list of sub-lists, with each sub-list representing an input
#'   scenario. The scenarios (sub-lists) each contain the following components:
#'   * scen.number: An integer value representing the scenario number (generated scenarios are numbered incrementally from 1).
#'   * road.rast: A logical `PackedSpatRaster` representing existing roads.  TRUE is existing road. FALSE is not existing road.
#'   * road.line: A sf object representing existing roads.
#'   * cost.rast: A `PackedSpatRaster` representing the cost of developing new roads on a given cell.
#'   * landings.points: A sf object representing landings sets and landing locations within each set. The data frame includes
#'   a field named 'set' which contains integer values representing the landings set that each point belongs to
#'   * landings.stack: A `PackedSpatRaster` with multiple layers representing the landings and landings sets. Each logical layer represents
#'   one landings set. Values of TRUE are a landing in the given set. Values of FALSE are not.
#'   * landings.poly: A sf object representing a single set of polygonal landings.
