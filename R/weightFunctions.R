#' Grade penalty edge weight function
#'
#' Method for calculating the weight of an edge between two nodes from the value
#' of the input raster at each of those nodes (`x1` and `x2`), designed for a single
#' DEM input. The method assumes an input `weightRaster` in which:
#'   * `NA` indicates a road cannot be built
#'   * Negative values are costs for crossing streams or other barriers that are
#'   crossable but expensive. Edges that link to barrier penalty (negative value)
#'   nodes are assigned the largest barrier penalty weight.
#'   * Zero values are assumed to be existing roads.
#'   * All other values are interpreted as elevation in the units of the raster
#'    map (so that a difference between two cells equal to the map resolution can be
#'     interpreted as 100% grade)
#' This is a simplified version of the grade penalty approach taken by Anderson and Nelson (2004):
#' The approach does not distinguish between adverse and favourable grades.
#' Default construction cost values are from the BC interior appraisal manual.
#' The approach ignores (unknown) grade penalties beside roads and barriers in order to
#' avoid increased memory and computational burden associated with multiple input rasters.

#' @param x1,x2 Number. Value of the input raster at two nodes.
#' @param hdistance Number. Horizontal distance between nodes. `hdistance`, `x1`, and `x2`
#'  should have the same units.
#' @param baseCost Number. Construction cost of 0% grade road per km.
#' @param limit Number. Maximum grade (%) on which roads can be built.
#' @param penalty Number. Cost increase (per km) associated with each
#'   additional % increase in road grade.
#' @param limitWeight Number. Value assigned to edges that exceed the grade
#'   limit. Try setting to a high (not `NA`) value if encountering problems with
#'   disconnected graphs.
