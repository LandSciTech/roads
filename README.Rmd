The roads package offers iterative least cost path and minimum spanning tree methods for projecting forest road networks. The methods connect a set of target points to an existing road network using igraph <https://igraph.org> to identify least cost routes. The cost of constructing a road segment between adjacent pixels is determined by a user supplied `weightRaster` and a `weightFunction`; options include the average of adjacent `weightRaster` values, and a function of the elevation differences between adjacent cells that penalizes steep grades. These road network projection methods are intended for integration into R workflows and modelling frameworks used for forecasting forest change, and can be applied over multiple timesteps without rebuilding a graph at each timestep.

## Installation

You can install the released version of roads from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("roads")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/LandSciTech/roads) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LandSciTech/roads")
```

## Example

To simulate the development of roads three inputs are needed: the current road
network, the locations that should be connected to the road network (landings),
and a weights raster that together with the weighting function determines the
cost to connect two raster cells with a road. Typically the roads and landings
are `sf` objects or `sp` Spatial\* objects and the weight is a raster.

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(roads)
library(raster)

# data set installed with roads package
demoScen <- prepExData(demoScen)
scen <- demoScen[[1]]

prRoads <- projectRoads(landings = scen$landings.points, 
                        weightRaster = scen$cost.rast,
                        roads = scen$road.line, 
                        plotRoads = TRUE) 

```

By default `projectRoads` uses an iterative least cost paths algorithm
(`roadMethod = "ilcp"`) to connect each landing to the existing road by the
lowest cost path, updating the cost after each landing is connected. A minimum spanning tree method (`roadMethod
= "mst"`) is also available.
